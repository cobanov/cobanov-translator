1
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,421
- Starting compressions.
- Let me get it attached.

2
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:31,677
- One, two, three. Breathe.
- Stand by and...

3
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,169
- One, two, three. Breathe.
- Yeah, we're good.

4
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,291
One, two, three. Breathe.
One, two, three. Breathe.

5
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,782
Come on, baby. Come on.

6
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:43,993
Still nothing.
Come on.

7
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:51,097
Will she be okay?

8
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,437
Who's going to tell him
to brush his teeth

9
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:59,316
before breakfast now?

10
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:02,782
Or go to Costco
to buy the right Nivea?

11
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:07,374
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,169
I know there's thousands
of parents

13
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:11,090
every year
who go through this.

14
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:13,762
I can do this.

15
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:16,058
I'm strong.

16
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:17,645
I hope.

17
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:20,317
Thank you for sharing, Cheryl.

18
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:24,366
This can be so challenging.

19
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,245
Especially for parents like us

20
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,792
who spend more time
with their children than most.

21
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,339
But if I remember correctly,

22
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:33,092
there's actually
one other parent here

23
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:34,596
going through the same thing.

24
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,144
Diane?

25
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:40,650
How do you feel?

26
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,785
How do I feel about...

27
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:50,293
Chloe's going to college
in a few months.

28
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,713
How do you feel?

29
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:54,343
Good.
